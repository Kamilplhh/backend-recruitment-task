# Backend/Full-stack recruitment task

----


Page has all of the requirments done, with some error handling. Second task is handled by jQuery.post() function, while third task is handled just by the source file of main.php.
I had only one problem with putting a controller into a diffrent folder, because if I did that main php couldnt find a user model, in my opinion it was some type of structure problem and adding simple .htaccess file would fix that but I gave up with that because I think it's just a little thing in this whole task
